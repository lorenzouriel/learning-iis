# Security Tips for IIS

## 1. Isolate Directory
- **Purpose**: Limit the access of web applications to only necessary directories.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use application pool identities to restrict file system permissions.
  - Set proper NTFS permissions on web directories to ensure only authorized users and services have access.
  - Create a directory with only IUSR access.

## 2. Firewall Settings
- **Purpose**: Protect the server from unauthorized access and attacks.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enable and configure Windows Firewall or a third-party firewall.
  - Allow only essential ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
  - Block all unused ports and restrict IP ranges as necessary.

## 3. Request Filtering
- **Purpose**: Control the types of HTTP requests processed by your server.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enable request filtering in IIS Manager.
  - Configure rules to block potentially dangerous requests (e.g., specific verbs, extensions, query string lengths).
  - Use the `<requestFiltering>` section in the `web.config` file for fine-tuned control.

## 4. IP Domain Restrictions
- **Purpose**: Limit access to your web applications based on IP addresses or domains.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the **IP Address and Domain Restrictions** feature in IIS.
  - Allow or deny access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
  - Implement dynamic IP restrictions to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## 5. Mime Types
- **Purpose**: Prevent serving unauthorized or potentially dangerous files.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define a whitelist of allowed MIME types.
  - Remove or block potentially dangerous MIME types (e.g., executable files).
  - Configure MIME types in IIS Manager under the **MIME Types** feature.

## 6. Error Pages
- **Purpose**: Prevent exposing sensitive server information through error messages.
- **Implementation**:
  - Customize error pages to provide user-friendly messages without revealing server details.
  - Configure custom error pages in IIS Manager under the **Error Pages** feature.
  - Use the `<customErrors>` section in the `web.config` file to handle specific HTTP status codes.

By implementing these security tips, you can enhance the security posture of your IIS server and protect your web applications from common threats.
